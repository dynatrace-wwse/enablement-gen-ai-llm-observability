Common LLM implementations include chatbots, data analysis, data extraction, code creation, and content creation. These AI-powered models offer benefits such as speed, scope, and scale. LLMs can quickly handle complex queries using a variety of data types from multiple data sources.</p> <p>However, synthesizing more data faster doesn't always mean better results. Models may function perfectly, but if the data sources aren't accurate, outputs will be inaccurate, as well. Furthermore, if the data is valid, but processes are flawed, results won't be reliable. Therefore, observability is necessary to ensure all aspects of LLM operation are correct and consistent.</p>"},{"location":"4-content/#key-components-of-llm-observability","title":"Key components of LLM observability","text":"<p>LLM observability has three key components:</p>"},{"location":"4-content/#output-evaluation","title":"Output evaluation","text":"<p>Teams must regularly evaluate outputs for accuracy and reliability.
